# 3DOF-robotic-arm-with-an-electroadhesic-gripper
As my electrical engineering master thesis I designed and built a 3DOF robotic arm, which is equipped with a gripper, that works based on the principle of electroadhesion.
This repository is created for documentational purposes, to show the process of design and the resources, softwares and components I used in this project.
These files and datas are free to use, if someone wants to build their own robotic arm. I'm trying to update this repository every time I reach some new milestone.
